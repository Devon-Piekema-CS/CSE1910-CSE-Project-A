# Log Message for Major Project for Week 4
## What was your goal for the past week?

To start working on the AI single player mode for Triple Misare Tic Tac Toe.

## Did you accomplish last weekâ€™s goal? Why/why not?

No,  I have come across a few problelms with coding the computer moves.  Its very ificult to code the computers moves, because there are so many posible moves it can make; the only thing I can think of doing is adding in all the responce moves individualy.  

## What did you learn this week?

I learned that coding an AI is much harder than I thought it would be.  Its getting more and more difficult to work on my project because of school Finals and Deplomas; so I have started working at a slower pase.

## What is your goal for next week?

Hopfully get more of the AI working and have some sort of apponant for single player mode; even if its note very good at the game.

## What are the main challenges you are facing next week?

To learn how to code AI without using hundreds of lines of code (which might not be posible).
