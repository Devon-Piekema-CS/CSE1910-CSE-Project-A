# Working Title:  Triple Misère Tic Tac Toe
## Name of Lead Designer(s): Devon Piekema

* Theme/Look:  Three Tic Tac Toe grids side by side.

## Materials & Methods
_What programing language will you be using? If you are not planing to use Processing explain why you chose a different programing language._  I will be writing all of my code using Processing, mainly because it is the only programming language I know.

## Program Specifications
_Fully describe your project below in one paragraph (minimum 5 sentences). Is it a game? A tool? If it is a game, what game genre is it?_  My project is a video game called Triple Misère Tic Tac Toe,  this is a game of Tic Tac Toe, with a few tweeks.  first, both players play using O's and avoid three in a row; second, three Tic Tac Toe grids are played simultaneously.  This game will have two modes, Singleplayer, and Multiplayer: Singleplayer will be played; Player VS Computer, and Multiplayer will be played; Player vs Player.  The computer will be programmed to always make the best move it can, with a small amount of randomness; and will always take victory if available to it.

## Potential Challenges
_Potential challenges. What are some of the challenges you think you will have to solve? How are you planing to solve them? What will you do if you are unable to solve some challenges?_  Programming AI will be dificult, but I sould be able tpo overcome that by using examples provided by "AreYouWorthy".  If all else fails, I should be able to get the Player VS Player working proficiently.  

## Time Line
_Describe in detail what you will complete by the end of each week (end of Friday class)._
* Week 1: Complete my Pitch and Proposal
* Week 2: Start coding Triple Misère Tic Tac Toe for Player VS Player.
* Week 3: Start coding AI, creat moves the computer shuld make after every Player move.
* Week 4: Continue from last week
* Week 5: Complete finishing touches for my project.

## 60%
_What will a 60% project look like?  In other words, what is the minimum expectations you have for yourself?  List some specific features of your project that are needed to reach 60%._ AI doesnt work very well, but Player VS Player works perfectly.

## 80%
_What does 80% look like?   List some specific features of your project that are needed to reach 80%._  AI works okey, but doesnt play as well as a human player.

## 90+%
_What does 90+% look like?   List some specific features of your project that are needed to reach 90+%._  The AI works Very well, AI Wins 9 / 10 times
